# ðŸš€ AREA INTRUDERS

**AREA INTRUDERS** is an arcade-style game inspired by the classic Space Invaders, developed as a project for the Object-Oriented Programming and GUI course. The main objective of the game is to defend your spaceship against an oncoming wave of enemies that descend rhythmically from the top of the screen.

The project was implemented in Java using the Swing library, while adhering to the principles of object-oriented programming.
